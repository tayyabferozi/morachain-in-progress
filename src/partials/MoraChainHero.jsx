            <p>
              Morachain is a real estate asset tokenization platform powered by
              blockchain with a purpose to make a decentralized ecosystem where
              investing in property is as simple as putting shares into the
              stock market. This is accomplished by stamping real estate NFT and
              fractionalizing it. Morachain has made a Metaverse planned as per
              the present properties.
